5 Class Design Principles[S.O.L.I.D] In JAVA:-
--------------------------------------------
1. Single Responsibility Principle ->

	One class = One Responsibility(1 purpose)

	 you should write, change and maintain a class for only one purpose.
	 If it is model class then it should strictly represent only one actor/ entity. 
	This will give you the flexibility to make changes in future without worrying the impacts of changes for another entity.




    Old Code:
    --------

     class Person {
   	private string name;
   	private surname : string;
   	private email : string;

  	constructor(name : string, surname : string, email : string){
       	this.surname = surname;
       	this.name = name;
      	 if(this.validateEmail(email)) {
         this.email = email;
       	}
       	else {
           throw new Error("Invalid email!");
          }
        }

     validateEmail(email : string) {
       var re = /^([\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)*)@((?:[\w-]+\.)*\w[\w-]{0,66})\.([a-z]{2,6}(?:\.[a-z]{2})?)$/i;
       return re.test(email);
      }
      greet() {
       alert("Hi!");
    }
}

applying Principle:
------------------

class Email {
   private String email;
   private String from;
private String to;
private String subject;

public Email(String email, String from, String to, String subject){



}
//getter and setter method goes here


   
}
class EmailValidator{

static boolean validateEmail(Email email) {
       //validation logic goes here.

   }
}


class Person {
   private String name;
   private String surname ;
   private Email email ;
  public Person(String name,String surname, Email email ){
       this.email = email;
       this.name = name;
       this.surname = surname;
   }
   

}

public static void main(String[] args){

Email email1 = new Email("emailTest","james@gmail.com", "bond@gmail.com", "Test1");

if(EmailValidator.validateEmail(email1)){
	Person person = new Person("James", "Bond", email1 );

}


}
